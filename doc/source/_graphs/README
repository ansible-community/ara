graph source files
==================

- recording-workflow.xml: a diagram export from draw.io.
  We're keeping it for version control purposes but the documentation uses actual images built from these from the ``doc/source/_static/graphs`` directory.

- database_graph_model.sh: instructions included in comments to generate a database graph model for the documentation.
  The rendered graph is available under ``doc/source/_static/graphs``.
